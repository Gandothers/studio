# **App Name**: Audio Scribe

## Core Features:

- Audio Upload: Audio Upload: Allow users to upload audio files (mp3, wav, etc.) via a simple drag-and-drop interface.
- AI Transcription: Transcription Service: Transcribe audio to text using AI; the tool decides which parts of the text need to be most accurate, based on sentence structure.
- Text Editor: Text Editor: Provide a text editor for users to view, correct, and format the transcribed text.
- Export Options: Format Options: Offer different export formats (e.g., .txt, .docx).

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light blue (#77B5FE), evoking clarity, focus, and technological precision.
- Background color: Very light blue (#F0F8FF) offering a clean and unobtrusive backdrop that prevents eye strain.
- Accent color: Soft violet (#B19CD9) used sparingly to draw attention to key interactive elements, but maintaining overall soft styling.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif font providing a modern, clean, and readable text.
- Use simple, clear icons from a minimalist set to represent actions like upload, play, edit, and export.
- A clean, intuitive layout with the audio upload prominent at the top, followed by the text editor, and export options below.
- Subtle animations, like a progress bar during audio processing and transcription, should give users a sense of activity without being distracting.
